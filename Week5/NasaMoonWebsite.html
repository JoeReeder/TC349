					<td class="Title_Cell">What I Changed</td>

				<tr>
					<td class="Title_Cell">Multimedia</td>
					<td class="Context">I combined the sections that led to images of the moon and put them in one seperate section. I also combined the sections that led to images of missions associated with this page and put them in a seperate section. The videos of the moon were put in a third section, and the videos of missions were put in a fourth. These four sections were grouped together into a multimedia section. I felt that there were many sections that has pictures and images of the moon, ect that were more or less showing the same information and had the same concept.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="Title_Cell">News and Events vs Calendar</td>
					<td class="Context">I moved around some of the content within the News and Event Sections. I felt that the title was miss leading for it gave national dates and other observences, while I felt the title of this section described events that were going on within NASA. This grouping difference simply moved some of the sections of the News and Events section and grouped it within Calendar section instead.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="Title_Cell">About the Moon</td>
					<td class="Context">With my grouping, the moon diagram that was on the main page was grouped within the about me section instead of being the main focus of the main page. In my opinion, this space could be better used to show some other information that more generalizes this page.
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="Title_Cell">Past Events</td>
					<td class="Context">As with the dates that were moved from the News and Events section to the Calendar section, I grouped past events with the facts section of this webpage. Like previously stated, I felt as if the News and Events section should be upcoming events and current news. With past events, they are more or less facts at the present time. This is why I more apporpriately moved them to the facts section. I would also rename this section to "Facts" and not "Moon Facts". Possibly with in the "Facts" section, there could be two sub-sections for facts about the moon and other facts.

				<tr>
					<td class="Title_Cell">Products</td>
					<td class="Context">I renamed the section "Products" to downloadable content or </td>

			<h2>Description of Process and Findings</h2>
			<p>The process I used for this website was that I first made the cards on index cards of all of the sections and pages of NASA's Moon website. Then, I did my sorting and grouping which is stated in the above table. After I sorted the index cards, three of my fraternity brothers also sorted the cards as I took notes.</p>
			<p>From my experience with this website's card sorting exercise, I realized that, in my opinion, this website is very unorganized. It was very hard for me to grasp the concept of what each section had. Some of the sections that I had expected to have certain information (based upon the title given) did not have that information. Also, Images, Videos, and a variety of dates were sparatically placed throughout the entire website.</p>
			<p>Much like my findings, my participants had similar groupings of the sections and pages. <em>All</em> particpants grouped the images and videos in one section, with their parent group being multimedia. The dates and events were split into their individual groupings and were grouped into a parent group along with the calendar. All facts were group together in the "About The Moon" section, and placed all of the missions along with the LADEE launch in a parent section of "Missions". Two of the three participants also added a "Contact" section to be more easily seen and changed the "Get Involved" section name to a more accurate name such as "Fun Related Activities", since it did not as much pertain to getting involved with the NASA program and more with projects and exibits to see.</p>
			<p>I felt that the sorting of my participants was a better representation of how unorganized this site was. My opinion was biased with the fact that I had previously seen the site and leaned more towards the original organization structure. However, both my participants and I came to very similar conclusions.</p>
