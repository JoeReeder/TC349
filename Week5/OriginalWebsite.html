	<h1>Final Project Plan</h1>

		<h2>Description of Website</h2>
		<p>For my website I am going to do for my final, I plan to make a website page for my fraternity. Over the years, we have struggled to find a decent website developer to one, make a website that is up to the standard of what my fraternity wants, and two, to keep the website updated. So I figure I can kill two birds with one stone and have us pay for server space and the domain name if the site is worthy. This website will have information such as the brothers currently active, information about our philanthropy events and our community service, history of our house, pictures of our members at various event, and many more sections. The information about the active brothers will be fashioned as a directory with a picture, major, name, and year with possibly more information. There are many events that we do either as philanthropy, Altruistic Campus Experience(ACE) project, alumni golf outings, ect that will each have their own page. There will also most likely be a contact us page so if someone would like to join or another group would like to join or events, they can contact us and do so. My fraternity also has a few social media pages that I would like to implement into my site such as a Twitter feed and Facebook posts to allow people to see what we have going on all in one place. Other pages will display facts about our fraternity such as our history on campus, or GPA, awards we have won, and more.</p>

	<section id="My_Sort">
		<h2>My Sort</h2>
		<p>I grouped committe/charimen section, history of the house, and statistics of the house in the "About Us" parent section. I also placed the FAQ, Social Media, and contact us in the "Public Relations" parent section. The photos and videos sections I grouped with the "Multimedia" parent group. I placed the "Alumni" and "Active Brothers" sections in a parent group named "Brothers". For all of the chairmen/committee pages (i.e. philanthropy, ACE, Community Service), each section got its own page. The statistics were grouped with their corresponding chair page, and the "Social" section encompased the calendar and secition on how to join the fraternity sections.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="Participant_Sorts">
		<h2>Participant Sorts</h2>
		<p> Most of the participants grouped the sections and pages the same as I did. They did, however, take out much of my content. They stated that most of the chair positions did not need their own page and that many of the sections could be grouped together (i.e. inernal awards and house awards under section "Awards").
